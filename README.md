Text analytics can be a bit overwhelming and frustrating at times
with the unstructured and noisy nature of textual data and the 
vast amount of information available. 
"Text Analytics with Python" is a book packed with 385 pages of useful information 
based on techniques, algorithms, experiences and various lessons learnt over time 
in analyzing text data. This repository contains datasets and code used in this book.
I will also be adding various notebooks and bonus content here from time to time.
